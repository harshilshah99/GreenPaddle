### ü§î Problem Statement
Renting Cycles on hourly/monthly basis is difficult nowadays and also traditional modes of transportation, such as cars and buses, contribute to air pollution and carbon emissions, which have negative effects on the environment and public health.

### üöÄ Solution
Thus, we have developed ***GreenPaddle***, a web solution that promotes cycling as a sustainable and healthy mode of transportation. It offers a cycle rental service, cycling accessories for purchase, information on cycling routes and events, and promotes a greener environment by encouraging people to choose cycling over other modes of transportation.
